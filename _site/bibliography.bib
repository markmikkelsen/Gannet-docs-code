abstract = {Water suppression is typically performed in vivo by exciting the longitudinal magnetization in combination with dephasing, or by using frequency-selective coherence generation. MEGA, a frequency-selective refocusing technique, can be placed into any pulse sequence element designed to generate a Hahn spin-echo or stimulated echo, to dephase transverse water coherences with minimal spectral distortions. Water suppression performance was verified in vivo using stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) localization, which provided water suppression comparable with that achieved with four selective pulses in 3,1-DRYSTEAM. The advantage of the proposed method was exploited for editing J-coupled resonances. Using a double-banded pulse that selectively inverts a J-coupling partner and simultaneously suppresses water, efficient metabolite editing was achieved in the point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) and STEAM sequences in which MEGA was incorporated. To illustrate the efficiency of the method, the detection of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was demonstrated, with minimal contributions from macromolecules and overlying singlet peaks at 4 T. The estimated occipital GABA concentration was consistent with previous reports, suggesting that editing for GABA is efficient when based on MEGA at high field strengths.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To establish image parameters for some routine clinical brain MRI pulse sequences at 3.0 T with the goal of maintaining, as much as possible, the well-characterized 1.5-T image contrast characteristics for daily clinical diagnosis, while benefiting from the increased signal to noise at higher field. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 10 healthy subjects were scanned on 1.5-T and 3.0-T systems for T(1) and T(2) relaxation time measurements of major gray and white matter structures. The relaxation times were subsequently used to determine 3.0-T acquisition parameters for spin-echo (SE), T(1)-weighted, fast spin echo (FSE) or turbo spin echo (TSE), T(2)-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) pulse sequences that give image characteristics comparable to 1.5 T, to facilitate routine clinical diagnostics. Application of the routine clinical sequences was performed in 10 subjects, five normal subjects and five patients with various pathologies. RESULTS: T(1) and T(2) relaxation times were, respectively, 14% to 30% longer and 12% to 19% shorter at 3.0 T when compared to the values at 1.5 T, depending on the region evaluated. When using appropriate parameters, routine clinical images acquired at 3.0 T showed similar image characteristics to those obtained at 1.5 T, but with higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), which can be used to reduce the number of averages and scan times. Recommended imaging parameters for these sequences are provided. CONCLUSION: When parameters are adjusted for changes in relaxation rates, routine clinical scans at 3.0 T can provide similar image appearance as 1.5 T, but with superior image quality and/or increased speed.},

abstract = {Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides hydraulic suspension for the brain. The general concept of bulk CSF production, circulation, and reabsorption is well established, but the mechanisms of momentary CSF volume variation corresponding to vasoreactive changes are far less understood. Nine individuals were studied in a 3T MR scanner with a protocol that included visual stimulation using a 10-Hz reversing checkerboard and administration of a 5% CO(2) mix in air. We acquired PRESS-localized spin-echoes (TR = 12 sec, TE = 26 ms to 1.5 sec) from an 8-mL voxel located in the visual cortex. Echo amplitudes were fitted to a two-compartmental model of relaxation to estimate the partial volume of CSF and the T(2) relaxation times of the tissues. CSF signal contributed 10.7 +/- 3% of the total, with T(2,csf) = 503.0 +/- 64.3 [ms], T(2,brain) = 61.0 +/- 2 [ms]. The relaxation time of tissue increased during physiological stimulation, while the fraction of signal contributed by CSF decreased significantly by 5-6% with visual stimulation (P < 0.03) and by 3% under CO(2) inhalation (P < 0.08). The CSF signal fraction is shown to represent well the volume changes under viable physiological scenarios. In conclusion, CSF plays a significant role in buffering the changes in cerebral blood volume, especially during rapid functional stimuli.},

Discrimination between CSF and tissue water is based on differences in their T2 relaxation times. The NMR-invisible compartment is assessed using an external standard. The composition of three regions in the human brain is determined. The CSF content of specific regions can be used to quantify cortical atrophy. The method provides a means for measuring the water content of brain tissue in vivo with a precision of 1.5%. After appropriate corrections, the results are in close agreement with biochemical values. The method has major applications in localized quantitative spectroscopy. The compartmentation model can be used to correct for the CSF content of the selected volume and to properly define and interconvert all major concentration units.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Frequency and phase drifts are a common problem in the acquisition of in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data. If not accounted for, frequency and phase drifts will result in artifactual broadening of spectral peaks, distortion of spectral lineshapes, and a reduction in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We present herein a new method for estimating and correcting frequency and phase drifts in in vivo MRS data.\n\nMETHODS: We used a simple method of fitting each spectral average to a reference scan (often the first average in the series) in the time domain through adjustment of frequency and phase terms. Due to the similarity with image registration, this method is referred to as "spectral registration." Using simulated data with known frequency and phase drifts, the performance of spectral registration was compared with two existing methods at various SNR levels.\n\nRESULTS: Spectral registration performed well in comparison with the other methods tested in terms of both frequency and phase drift estimation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Spectral registration provides an effective method for frequency and phase drift correction. It does not involve the collection of navigator echoes, and does not rely on any specific resonances, such as residual water or creatine, making it highly versatile.

abstract = {Spatially localized methods in spectroscopy often operate with magnetic field gradients for volume selection. The eddy currents induced by these gradients produce time-dependent shifts of the resonance frequency in the selected volume, which results in a distortion of the spectrum after Fourier transformation. In whole-body systems the complete compensation of eddy currents is a difficult procedure. To avoid this, a correction method is proposed for proton spectroscopy, which uses the signal of prominent water protons as a reference for the water-suppressed signal. The correction is performed in the time domain, dividing the water-suppressed signal by the phase factor of the water signal for each data point. The corrected spectra have a good resolution as shown by phantom measurements and brain and muscle spectra of volunteers.},

abstract = {Relaxation time measurements at 3.0 T are reported for both gray and white matter in normal human brain. Measurements were made using a 3.0 T Bruker Biospec magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner in normal adults with no clinical evidence of neurological disease. Nineteen subjects, 8 female and 11 male, were studied for T1 and T2 measurements, and 7 males were studied for T*2. Measurements were made using a saturation recovery method for T1, a multiple spin-echo experiment for T2, and a fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence with 14 different echo times for T*2. Results of the measurements are summarized as follows. Average T1 values measured for gray matter and white matter were 1331 and 832 msec, respectively. Average T2 values measured for gray matter and white matter were 80 and 110 msec, respectively. The average T*2 values for occipital and frontal gray matter were 41.6 and 51.8 msec, respectively. Average T*2 values for occipital and frontal white matter were 48.4 and 44.7 msec, respectively. ANOVA tests of the measurements revealed that for both gray and white matter there were no significant differences in T1 from one location in the brain to another. T2 in occipital gray matter was significantly higher (0.0001 < P < .0375) than the rest of the gray matter, while T2 in frontal white matter was significantly lower (P < 0.0001). Statistical analysis of cerebral hemispheric differences in relaxation time measurements showed no significant differences in T1 values from the left hemisphere compared with the right, except in insular gray matter, where this difference was significant at P = 0.0320. No significant difference in T2 values existed between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Significant differences were apparent between male and female relaxation time measurements in brain. J.

Using data from healthy human subjects, it is shown that different image segmentation approaches that are commonly used to account for partial volume effects (SPM2, FSL's FAST, and K-means) lead to different estimates of metabolite levels, particularly in gray matter (GM), owing primarily to variability in the estimates of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fraction. While consistency does not necessarily validate a method, a multispectral segmentation approach using FAST yielded the lowest intersubject variability in the estimates of GM metabolites. The mean GM and white matter (WM) levels of N-acetyl groups (NAc, primarily N-acetylaspartate), choline (Ch), and creatine (Cr) obtained in these subjects using the described method with FAST multispectral segmentation are reported: GM [NAc] = 17.16 +/- 1.19 mM; WM [NAc] = 14.26 +/- 1.38 mM; GM [Ch] = 3.27 +/- 0.47 mM; WM [Ch] = 2.65 +/- 0.25 mM; GM [Cr] = 13.98 +/- 1.20 mM; and WM [Cr] = 7.10 +/- 0.67 mM.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the repeatability of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) measurements using J-difference editing, before and after spectral realignment-a technique which has previously been demonstrated to improve the quality of J-difference GABA spectra.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed in vivo measurements in three brain regions (occipital, sensorimotor, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC]), and analyzed these using alternative alignment approaches to evaluate the impact of alignment on repeatability: "Independent alignment" (aligning each subspectrum independently) and "Pairwise alignment" (aligning each on and off subspectrum as a pair) were compared.\n\nRESULTS: Pairwise alignment improved the group mean coefficient of variation in all regions; 0.4% in occipital, 1.1% in sensorimotor, and 1.1% in DLPFC. Independent alignment resulted in subtraction artifacts in the majority of cases, and increased the coefficient of variation in the DLPFC by 9.4%. Simulations demonstrate that the GABA quantification error in datasets with high B0 drift, is 4.5% without alignment, but <1% with optimal alignment.\n\nCONCLUSION: Pairwise alignment improves the repeatability of GABA spectroscopy data. However, independently aligning all on and off subspectra can lead to artifacts and worse repeatability when compared with nonaligned data.},
