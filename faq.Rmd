### General

#### **Can Gannet process GSH-edited data?**

Yes, Gannet can process GABA-, GSH-, and Lac-edited MEGA-PRESS data as well as HERMES data. Simply set the appropriate `target` option(s) in `GannetPreInitialise.m`.

#### **Can Gannet process phantom data?**

Yes. Make sure to set `phantom` to `1` under 'Flags' in `GannetPreInitialise.m`. If you want to fit your data, run `GannetFitPhantom(MRS_struct);` instead of `GannetFit(MRS_struct);`.


### Output

#### **Why is my spectrum upside down after I run GannetLoad?**

**Example:**

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '35%', fig.align = 'left'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/faq/upside-down-spectrum.png')
```

The `ONOFForder` parameter set in `GannetPreInitialise.m` is incorrect for your data. Change the setting to either `'onfirst'` or `'offfirst'`, depending on what it is currently set as.


### Errors

#### **Why am I getting this error:** <span style="color: red;">`Subscripted assignment dimension mismatch`</span>**?**

This is one of the errors that may appear during batch processing if acquisition parameters are not consistent across datasets.

#### **Why am I getting this error:** <span style="color: red;">`Unable to perform assignment because the size of the left side is 1-by-#### and the size of the right side is 1-by-###`</span>**?**

You are batch-processing multiple datasets that contain different numbers of averages. Divide the files into separate batches so that each batch contains only datasets acquired with the same number of averages.
