abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the repeatability of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) measurements using J-difference editing, before and after spectral realignment-a technique which has previously been demonstrated to improve the quality of J-difference GABA spectra.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed in vivo measurements in three brain regions (occipital, sensorimotor, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC]), and analyzed these using alternative alignment approaches to evaluate the impact of alignment on repeatability: "Independent alignment" (aligning each subspectrum independently) and "Pairwise alignment" (aligning each on and off subspectrum as a pair) were compared.\n\nRESULTS: Pairwise alignment improved the group mean coefficient of variation in all regions; 0.4% in occipital, 1.1% in sensorimotor, and 1.1% in DLPFC. Independent alignment resulted in subtraction artifacts in the majority of cases, and increased the coefficient of variation in the DLPFC by 9.4%. Simulations demonstrate that the GABA quantification error in datasets with high B0 drift, is 4.5% without alignment, but <1% with optimal alignment.\n\nCONCLUSION: Pairwise alignment improves the repeatability of GABA spectroscopy data. However, independently aligning all on and off subspectra can lead to artifacts and worse repeatability when compared with nonaligned data.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an experimental approach for determining in vivo transverse relaxation rates (T(2)) of metabolites that are detected by spectral editing without using simulations, and to demonstrate this approach to measure the T(2) of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA).\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The proposed method first determines the TE-dependence of the edited signals using measurements in a pure phantom solution (10 mM $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid; GABA); the phantom T(2) is also determined. Once the editing echo time (TE)-modulation pattern is known, it can then be used to determine T(2) in vivo. The method was applied to measure GABA T(2) in the occipital lobe of five healthy adult subjects at 3T, using a J-difference editing method. Unwanted macromolecular contributions to the GABA signal were also measured.\n\nRESULTS: The in vivo T(2) of edited GABA signal was 88 ± 12 ms; this preliminary result is somewhat shorter than other metabolite T(2) values in the literature at this field strength.\n\nCONCLUSION: Spectral editing methods are now widely used to detect low concentration metabolites, such as GABA, but to date no edited acquisition methods have been proposed for the measurement of transverse relaxation times (T(2)). The method described has been successfully applied to measuring the T(2) of GABA.},

abstract = {Relaxation time measurements at 3.0 T are reported for both gray and white matter in normal human brain. Measurements were made using a 3.0 T Bruker Biospec magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner in normal adults with no clinical evidence of neurological disease. Nineteen subjects, 8 female and 11 male, were studied for T1 and T2 measurements, and 7 males were studied for T*2. Measurements were made using a saturation recovery method for T1, a multiple spin-echo experiment for T2, and a fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence with 14 different echo times for T*2. Results of the measurements are summarized as follows. Average T1 values measured for gray matter and white matter were 1331 and 832 msec, respectively. Average T2 values measured for gray matter and white matter were 80 and 110 msec, respectively. The average T*2 values for occipital and frontal gray matter were 41.6 and 51.8 msec, respectively. Average T*2 values for occipital and frontal white matter were 48.4 and 44.7 msec, respectively. ANOVA tests of the measurements revealed that for both gray and white matter there were no significant differences in T1 from one location in the brain to another. T2 in occipital gray matter was significantly higher (0.0001 < P < .0375) than the rest of the gray matter, while T2 in frontal white matter was significantly lower (P < 0.0001). Statistical analysis of cerebral hemispheric differences in relaxation time measurements showed no significant differences in T1 values from the left hemisphere compared with the right, except in insular gray matter, where this difference was significant at P = 0.0320. No significant difference in T2 values existed between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Significant differences were apparent between male and female relaxation time measurements in brain. J.

abstract = {Spatially localized methods in spectroscopy often operate with magnetic field gradients for volume selection. The eddy currents induced by these gradients produce time-dependent shifts of the resonance frequency in the selected volume, which results in a distortion of the spectrum after Fourier transformation. In whole-body systems the complete compensation of eddy currents is a difficult procedure. To avoid this, a correction method is proposed for proton spectroscopy, which uses the signal of prominent water protons as a reference for the water-suppressed signal. The correction is performed in the time domain, dividing the water-suppressed signal by the phase factor of the water signal for each data point. The corrected spectra have a good resolution as shown by phantom measurements and brain and muscle spectra of volunteers.},

abstract = {Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides hydraulic suspension for the brain. The general concept of bulk CSF production, circulation, and reabsorption is well established, but the mechanisms of momentary CSF volume variation corresponding to vasoreactive changes are far less understood. Nine individuals were studied in a 3T MR scanner with a protocol that included visual stimulation using a 10-Hz reversing checkerboard and administration of a 5% CO(2) mix in air. We acquired PRESS-localized spin-echoes (TR = 12 sec, TE = 26 ms to 1.5 sec) from an 8-mL voxel located in the visual cortex. Echo amplitudes were fitted to a two-compartmental model of relaxation to estimate the partial volume of CSF and the T(2) relaxation times of the tissues. CSF signal contributed 10.7 +/- 3% of the total, with T(2,csf) = 503.0 +/- 64.3 [ms], T(2,brain) = 61.0 +/- 2 [ms]. The relaxation time of tissue increased during physiological stimulation, while the fraction of signal contributed by CSF decreased significantly by 5-6% with visual stimulation (P < 0.03) and by 3% under CO(2) inhalation (P < 0.08). The CSF signal fraction is shown to represent well the volume changes under viable physiological scenarios. In conclusion, CSF plays a significant role in buffering the changes in cerebral blood volume, especially during rapid functional stimuli.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To establish image parameters for some routine clinical brain MRI pulse sequences at 3.0 T with the goal of maintaining, as much as possible, the well-characterized 1.5-T image contrast characteristics for daily clinical diagnosis, while benefiting from the increased signal to noise at higher field. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 10 healthy subjects were scanned on 1.5-T and 3.0-T systems for T(1) and T(2) relaxation time measurements of major gray and white matter structures. The relaxation times were subsequently used to determine 3.0-T acquisition parameters for spin-echo (SE), T(1)-weighted, fast spin echo (FSE) or turbo spin echo (TSE), T(2)-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) pulse sequences that give image characteristics comparable to 1.5 T, to facilitate routine clinical diagnostics. Application of the routine clinical sequences was performed in 10 subjects, five normal subjects and five patients with various pathologies. RESULTS: T(1) and T(2) relaxation times were, respectively, 14% to 30% longer and 12% to 19% shorter at 3.0 T when compared to the values at 1.5 T, depending on the region evaluated. When using appropriate parameters, routine clinical images acquired at 3.0 T showed similar image characteristics to those obtained at 1.5 T, but with higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), which can be used to reduce the number of averages and scan times. Recommended imaging parameters for these sequences are provided. CONCLUSION: When parameters are adjusted for changes in relaxation rates, routine clinical scans at 3.0 T can provide similar image appearance as 1.5 T, but with superior image quality and/or increased speed.},

abstract = {The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

Materials and Methods: Phantom and in vivo brain MRS experiments on a 7 T scanner equipped with a 32-channel receiver coil, as well as Monte Carlo simulations, were performed to compare the coefficient of variation (CV) of the GLS method with those of two recently reported spectral combination methods. Results: Compared to the two existing methods, the GLS method significantly reduced CV values for the simulation, phantom, and in vivo experiments.

abstract = {Water suppression is typically performed in vivo by exciting the longitudinal magnetization in combination with dephasing, or by using frequency-selective coherence generation. MEGA, a frequency-selective refocusing technique, can be placed into any pulse sequence element designed to generate a Hahn spin-echo or stimulated echo, to dephase transverse water coherences with minimal spectral distortions. Water suppression performance was verified in vivo using stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) localization, which provided water suppression comparable with that achieved with four selective pulses in 3,1-DRYSTEAM. The advantage of the proposed method was exploited for editing J-coupled resonances. Using a double-banded pulse that selectively inverts a J-coupling partner and simultaneously suppresses water, efficient metabolite editing was achieved in the point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) and STEAM sequences in which MEGA was incorporated. To illustrate the efficiency of the method, the detection of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was demonstrated, with minimal contributions from macromolecules and overlying singlet peaks at 4 T. The estimated occipital GABA concentration was consistent with previous reports, suggesting that editing for GABA is efficient when based on MEGA at high field strengths.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the validity of different approaches to determine the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in MRI experiments with multi-element surface coils, parallel imaging, and different reconstruction filters. Materials and Methods: Four different approaches of SNR calculation were compared in phantom measurements and in vivo based on: 1) the pixel-by-pixel standard deviation (SD) in multiple repeated acquisitions; 2) the signal statistics in a difference image; and 3) and 4) the statistics in two separate regions of a single image employing either the mean value or the SD of background noise. Different receiver coil systems (with one and eight channels), acquisitions with and without parallel imaging, and five different reconstruction filters were compared. Results: Averaged over all phantom measurements, the deviations from the reference value provided by the multiple-acquisitions method are 2.7% (SD 1.6%) for the difference method, 37.7% (25.9%) for the evaluation of the mean value of background noise, and 34.0% (38.1%) for the evaluation of the SD of background noise. Conclusion: The conventionally determined SNR based on separate signal and noise regions in a single image will in general not agree with the true SNR measured in images after the application of certain reconstruction filters, multichannel reconstruction, or parallel imaging. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Frequency and phase drifts are a common problem in the acquisition of in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data. If not accounted for, frequency and phase drifts will result in artifactual broadening of spectral peaks, distortion of spectral lineshapes, and a reduction in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We present herein a new method for estimating and correcting frequency and phase drifts in in vivo MRS data.\n\nMETHODS: We used a simple method of fitting each spectral average to a reference scan (often the first average in the series) in the time domain through adjustment of frequency and phase terms. Due to the similarity with image registration, this method is referred to as "spectral registration." Using simulated data with known frequency and phase drifts, the performance of spectral registration was compared with two existing methods at various SNR levels.\n\nRESULTS: Spectral registration performed well in comparison with the other methods tested in terms of both frequency and phase drift estimation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Spectral registration provides an effective method for frequency and phase drift correction. It does not involve the collection of navigator echoes, and does not rely on any specific resonances, such as residual water or creatine, making it highly versatile.

abstract = {Quality control of MRI is essential for excluding problematic acquisitions and avoiding bias in subsequent image processing and analysis. Visual inspection is subjective and impractical for large scale datasets. Although automated quality assessments have been demonstrated on single-site datasets, it is unclear that solutions can generalize to unseen data acquired at new sites. Here, we introduce the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC), a tool for extracting quality measures and fitting a binary (accept/exclude) classifier. Our tool can be run both locally and as a free online service via the OpenNeuro.org portal. The classifier is trained on a publicly available, multi-site dataset (17 sites, N = 1102). We perform model selection evaluating different normalization and feature exclusion approaches aimed at maximizing across-site generalization and estimate an accuracy of 76%±13% on new sites, using leave-one-site-out cross-validation. We confirm that result on a held-out dataset (2 sites, N = 265) also obtaining a 76% accuracy. Even though the performance of the trained classifier is statistically above chance, we show that it is susceptible to site effects and unable to account for artifacts specific to new sites. MRIQC performs with high accuracy in intra-site prediction, but performance on unseen sites leaves space for improvement which might require more labeled data and new approaches to the between-site variability. Overcoming these limitations is crucial for a more objective quality assessment of neuroimaging data, and to enable the analysis of extremely large and multi-site samples.},

abstract = {Purpose To develop a tissue correction for GABA-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) that appropriately addresses differences in voxel gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fractions. Materials and Methods Simulations compared the performance of tissue correction approaches. Corrections were then applied to in vivo data from 16 healthy volunteers, acquired at 3T. GM, WM, and CSF fractions were determined from T1-weighted images. Corrections for CSF content, GM/WM GABA content, and water relaxation of the three compartments are combined into a single, fully corrected measurement. Results Simulations show that CSF correction increases the dependence of GABA measurements on GM/WM fraction, by an amount equal to the fraction of CSF. Furthermore, GM correction substantially (and nonlinearly) increases the dependence of GABA measurements on GM/WM fraction, for example, by a factor of over four when the voxel GM tissue fraction is 50%. At this tissue fraction, GABA is overestimated by a factor of 1.5. For the in vivo data, correcting for voxel composition increased measured GABA values (P<0.001 for all regions), but did not reduce intersubject variance (P>0.5 for all regions). Corrected GABA values differ significantly based on the segmentation procedure used (P<0.0001) and tissue parameter assumptions made (P<0.0001). Conclusion We introduce a comprehensive tissue correction factor that adjusts GABA measurements to correct for different voxel compositions of GM, WM, and CSF.},

The composition of three regions in the human brain is determined. The CSF content of specific regions can be used to quantify cortical atrophy. The method provides a means for measuring the water content of brain tissue in vivo with a precision of 1.5%. After appropriate corrections, the results are in close agreement with biochemical values. The method has major applications in localized quantitative spectroscopy.

abstract = {A strategy for using tissue water as a concentration standard in 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging studies on the brain is presented, and the potential errors that may arise when the method is used are examined. The sensitivity of the method to errors in estimates of the different water compartment relaxation times is shown to be small at short echo times (TEs). Using data from healthy human subjects, it is shown that different image segmentation approaches that are commonly used to account for partial volume effects (SPM2, FSL's FAST, and K-means) lead to different estimates of metabolite levels, particularly in gray matter (GM), owing primarily to variability in the estimates of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fraction. While consistency does not necessarily validate a method, a multispectral segmentation approach using FAST yielded the lowest intersubject variability in the estimates of GM metabolites. The mean GM and white matter (WM) levels of N-acetyl groups (NAc, primarily N-acetylaspartate), choline (Ch), and creatine (Cr) obtained in these subjects using the described method with FAST multispectral segmentation are reported: GM [NAc] = 17.16 ± 1.19 mM; WM [NAc] = 14.26 ± 1.38 mM; GM [Ch] = 3.27 ± 0.47 mM; WM [Ch] = 2.65 ± 0.25 mM; GM [Cr] = 13.98 ± 1.20 mM; and WM [Cr] = 7.10 ± 0.67 mM. {\textcopyright} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
