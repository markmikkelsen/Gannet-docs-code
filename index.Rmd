::: release
<h3>Current stable release: <a href="https://github.com/markmikkelsen/Gannet" target="_blank" class="badge badge-secondary">3.3.0</a></h3>
:::

## Overview

Gannet is a free, open-source MATLAB-based software toolkit for analyzing edited single-voxel ^1^H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data. Its largely automated functions cover all the essential steps of modern MRS analysis:

-   Loading raw data
-   Substantial preprocessing
-   Signal modeling
-   Voxel co-registration with structural MR images
-   Concentration estimation based on tissue composition

Several existing software packages for MRS data analysis require substantial user input or offer a wide selection of processing options. In contrast, the philosophy behind Gannet is to provide users with a complete automated pipeline without the need for significant user input.

Additionally, as open-source software, advanced users have the ability to modify the underlying routines for ad hoc purposes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Gannet runs in <a href="https://mathworks.com/products/matlab.html" target="_blank">MATLAB</a>. For best performance, we recommend using the latest release if possible. Additionally, Gannet requires that the following MATLAB toolboxes are installed:

-   Image Processing
-   Optimization
-   Signal Processing
-   Statistics and Machine Learning

You can check which toolboxes you have installed by typing `ver` in the MATLAB command window. To install any missing toolboxes, please follow these <a href="https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/101885-how-do-i-install-additional-toolboxes-into-an-existing-installation-of-matlab" target="_blank">instructions</a>.

To run the voxel co-registration and structural image segmentation modules, <a href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/" target="_blank">SPM12</a> must be installed.

### Download

The simplest way to install Gannet is to download the code from the <a href="https://github.com/markmikkelsen/Gannet" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> and move the `Gannet-main/` directory into your MATLAB directory.

Alternatively, git-savvy users can clone the Gannet repository into a directory of their choice:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/markmikkelsen/Gannet.git
```

The development version can be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/markmikkelsen/Gannet/tree/dev" target="_blank">development branch</a> on GitHub or by using the following git command if the repository was cloned:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git checkout dev
```

Stable releases can be found <a href="https://github.com/markmikkelsen/Gannet/releases" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Setup

Open the *Set Path* dialog box from the MATLAB menu (or run the command `pathtool` in the Command Window), click *Add with Subfolders...*, find the downloaded Gannet directory, and then select it. When done, press *Save* to permanently save the Gannet directory to MATLAB's default search path.

SPM12 can be installed in the same manner after it has been downloaded from the SPM website.

::: info
<i class="fa fa-info-circle" style="color: white"></i> It is highly recommended that you only add the main SPM12 directory (`spm12/`) to your search path instead of including all the subdirectories. This prevents function conflicts.
:::

## Compatibility

Gannet is currently being developed in MATLAB R2022b in macOS 13.1 Ventura. While reasonable effort is made to ensure legacy and cross-OS compatibility, an error-free user experience is not guaranteed.

## Supported file formats

At present, the following MRS data file formats are supported:

-   DICOM (.dcm)
-   GE P-file (.7)
-   NIfTI-MRS (.nii[.gz])
-   Philips .data/.list
-   Philips .raw
-   Philips .sdat/.spar
-   Siemens DICOM (.ima)
-   Siemens .rda
-   Siemens TWIX (.dat)

For creating and co-registering voxel masks, structural images need to be in NIfTI format (DICOM files can also be used if processing GE P-files).

::: warning
<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" style="color: white"></i> Philips users: Do not use structural images exported using the *fsl-nifti* option as this creates problems with co-registration in Gannet.

## Getting help

If you encounter any problems, please first check the Documentation or <a href="https://markmikkelsen.github.io/Gannet-docs/faq.html">FAQ</a> for a solution.

Otherwise, you can post your query on the <a href="https://forum.mrshub.org/c/mrs-software/gannet/9" target="_blank">Gannet forum</a> on <a href="https://mrshub.org/" target="_blank">MRSHub</a>.

The Gannet team can also be directly <a href="mailto:mam4041@med.cornell.edu?subject=[Gannet]%20<subject>" target="_blank">contacted</a>. We will do our best to work with you to solve your issue.

## Versioning

<a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic versioning</a> is used when updates are made to Gannet using the style 'x.x.x'. Versioning is also conducted on a module-specific basis using the style 'YYMMDD'. That is, each Gannet module has its own release version.
